    <b>The KISS principle (or Keep It Simple, Stupid) states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made overly complicated. When building a product, designing a website, creating an app, or engineering a block of code, strive for simplicity.</b>
    <br><br>
    Personally, for me, this basically means that if there is a simple method for accomplishing something, then that method should be the one chosen and executed. This is very much relevant in software engineering and web development as there can be countless ways of accomplishing a particular goal. Another way of thinking about this best practice is to always consider the larger and deeper context of a goal. Simple does not always mean less complicated; it can usually mean as appropriate for the situation too. My belief is that a solution that is not too complicated, but not appropriate for a certain problem, is actually not simple. That solution didn't pass the test of whether it is actually attacking the problem properly or not.
    <br><br>
    <b>A key tenet of KISS is that you must obsess over the customer and make decisions that benefit these stakeholders.</b>
    <br><br>
    What this means is being able to think from the perspective of the end user, or the person who is going to be using the piece of software that the engineer makes. A level of empathy is needed in order to keep things simple. It is going to be obvious that there is a lack of empathy in the software development process when the final end user is still stuck with the same problem that was originally bugging them. When using the KISS principle in design, it is paramount to think about end users and work backwards.
    <br><br>
    <b>In the world of software and technology, KISS is integral to good design.</b>
    <br><br>
    There are so many things that go through people's minds every second. Even for software engineers who write and breathe code for a living. Because code is cheap, there are infinite ways of doing things through code and software. In terms of software-based products and systems, technology isn't always well-understood by the general public. And for any given product type, users might have dozens of similar options to choose from. In a market like this, if one can deliver the goods in a straightforward way – then it's going to be easier for them to be more successful.
